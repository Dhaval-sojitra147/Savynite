## Code Highlights 🔍

### Theme Management 🎨

Switch between light and dark themes dynamically using a context API and hooks:

```typescript
import React, { createContext, useState, useContext } from 'react';

type ThemeContextType = {
  isDarkMode: boolean;
  toggleTheme: () => void;
};

const ThemeContext = createContext<ThemeContextType | undefined>(undefined);

export const ThemeProvider: React.FC = ({ children }) => {
  const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState(false);

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setIsDarkMode((prev) => !prev);
  };

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ isDarkMode, toggleTheme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
};

export const useTheme = () => {
  const context = useContext(ThemeContext);
  if (!context) throw new Error('useTheme must be used within ThemeProvider');
  return context;
};
```

### API Integration 🌐

Fetch live financial data using the `axios` library:

```typescript
import axios from 'axios';

export const fetchData = async (url: string) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(url);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

### Budget Tracking Logic 📉

Calculate remaining budgets dynamically:

```typescript
export const calculateRemainingBudget = (
  totalBudget: number,
  expenses: number
): number => {
  return totalBudget - expenses;
};
```
